# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating PocketBase database with an existing Next.js 15 website. The website has all UI components and pages built, but currently lacks dynamic data integration. The integration will connect the PocketBase backend to populate content across all pages including blogs, careers, testimonials, pricing, and other dynamic sections while following Next.js 15 best practices and maintaining clean architecture principles.

## Glossary

- **PocketBase**: An open-source backend service providing REST API for database operations
- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router and Server Components
- **Server Component**: React component that renders on the server and can directly fetch data
- **Client Component**: React component that renders on the client with interactivity
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**: Next.js feature for updating static pages after build time
- **Service Layer**: Abstraction layer containing data fetching logic separated from UI
- **Type Safety**: Using TypeScript types to ensure data structure consistency
- **Collection**: PocketBase database table containing records
- **Server Action**: Next.js server-side function for handling form submissions and mutations
